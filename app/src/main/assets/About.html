        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexbot is the control app for the drone project of the same name. It is the easiest way to fly your tiny drone. It connects to Flexbot via BLE 4.0, and has remote control ability with a range of about 25 meters.

        <div id="key">
        <storng>3 keys to fly flexbot well</storng>
        <ul>
        	<li>First of all, put you phone in a flat surface，put it flat. This is important.</li>
        	<li>Push the throttle very slowly at the beginning when you fly it, I mean it. Seriously, very very slowly at the first until you get the hand feel of operating and balancing it. Just push it little by little.</li>
        	<li>Don’t tilt the phone or tablet too much, the copter is super sensitive, it can fly away if you tilt too much. So make sure you tilt it slowly, no matter which direction, just slightly.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always keep the Flexbot in sight. Avoid flying the Flexbot close to young children, domestic animals or fragile objects. Always keep a minimum distance of about 80 inches (2 meters) between the spinning propellers and people, pets, or other objects. Children may require adult assistance when operating the copter. Do not expose the battery to heat or dispose of in a fire.
